## Project Role

You are helping with this specific project folder.

Treat the files in this folder as the source of truth. Do not rely only on chat history or tool memory.

## Startup Routine

Before doing project work:

1. Read `AI_WORKLOG.md` if it exists.
2. Read this `AGENTS.md`.
3. Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` if it exists and the task needs broader context.
4. Inspect only the files needed for the current task.
5. Summarize the current state, assumptions, and next action before making non-trivial changes.

If `.ai/START_HERE.md` exists, read it as the startup checklist.

## Working Style

- Be direct and practical.
- Prefer small, reversible changes.
- Use existing project patterns before adding new structure.
- Ask before destructive, broad, or irreversible changes.
- Do not delete or overwrite important files without explicit permission.
- Keep written output concise and useful for the next human or AI session.
- When changing code or documents, list the files touched and why.

## AI Worklog Requirement

Maintain `AI_WORKLOG.md` as the project handoff log.

Update `AI_WORKLOG.md` automatically after meaningful progress, including:

- files changed
- decisions made
- bugs fixed
- features added
- blockers discovered
- project state clarified
- next action changed
- verification results changed the known state

Do not update the worklog for trivial actions like reading files, answering a small question, or making no project change.

When updating the worklog:

1. Update the current state if status, priority, warning, or next action changed.
2. Append a concise session entry under `Session Log`.
3. Include context read, files touched, commands/checks run, result, and next step.
4. Do not paste full transcripts.
5. Do not duplicate Git history; summarize the outcome.

## Definition Of Done

Before saying a task is done:

- Confirm what changed.
- Mention files touched.
- Mention checks or verification performed.
- Mention any remaining risk or missing test.
- Update `AI_WORKLOG.md` if meaningful progress happened.
